### **CTG Chain: A proposed Blockchain-based platform for providing charitable meal tickets to those in need.**
### **Charity through CTG Chain, a blockchain cryptocurrency solution to transparent, low cost, and instant charity.**

### **1.0 Background** 
CTG Chain is a blockchain platform that provides a layer 2 ERC-20 Ethereum-based blockchain solution that allows donors and charities to transfer payments directly to selected participants completely transparent, fast, and cost-effective. It intends to reduce the cost of typical charity intermediary administration, management, and marketing while simultaneously rewarding CTG Chain contributors for their monetary and volunteer contributions.

### **2.0 Problem statement** 

Donors are often unsure of the actual amount that winds up in the hands of front-line users who offer food and services to the impoverished. 
Charities are already incurring high costs to make volunteer activities viable, and raising funds can be difficult. Often, charitable expenditure is imprecise and opaque to the giver. The limitations of current web2 technology make this considerably more difficult. 
It may be challenging to keep track of the expenditure and reciprocity of charitable funds and their price. Finding a solution to reduce administrative costs while directly tracking donor monies to expenditure could be difficult, if not impossible.


### **3.0**Feasiblity 

As a novel technology, blockchain technology is a transparent and secure mechanism to track the movement of funds from donor to charity while also being available on the Internet. It also enables Charities to streamline some expenditures and transactions, resulting in an auditable trail of blockchain data which is increasingly accepted by the public.The CTG Chain solution uses Blockchain Technology to streamline transactional data between a contributor and a charity.

Converting ETH to CTG provides an instant platform for transferring monies from donor to charity and then end-user as well as service providers while also preserving these transactions on the CTG Chain and prompting a series of linked contract events to support the chain, its operations, administration, and marketing via a support fee ted. The actions are automated by the built-in Solidity code programmed on Ethereum-based blockchain contracts. 


### **4.0 Solution** 


4.1 CTG Chain is an Ethereum-based smart contract and platform that generates its own cryptocurrency to replace the traditional charity process from donor to people in need. CTG is a utility token used to fund a network that is still expected to be distributed via an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The ICO is critical for project development funding, and the principles below apply to CTG.

Total Supply: 500 Million CTG (CTG 500,000,000) 

- 10% holdings for the founders of GYV CHAIN (GYV 50,000,000) 
- 10% for operational development & upkeep of the platform (GYV 50,000,000) 
- 55% locked until after initial coin offering and will be released on [TBC] date (CTG 
- 250,000,000) 
- 25% ICO initial coin offering at launch (CTG 150,000,000) 

4.2 Tokenomics 
Incentives are also crucial lubricants for motivating users to improve blockchain security and transaction validation. As a result, incentives are critical for implementing unique functionality in the relevant blockchain network. Participants that obey the rules of a particular network are rewarded with cryptocurrency.



With CTG Chain, fully transparent tokenomics secure the project's legality, creates trust with donors and charity, and provide a tight audit and record of blockchain activities. Every transaction with CTG delivers 95 percent of the donor's donation to the charity, and the remaining 5 percent support tithe is distributed as follows:


**5% support fee on every CTG transaction** 
• 1 % of every successful transaction from or to CTG is added to a separate locked pool for six months (180 days). This CTG amount is intended to increase liquidity and aid in the pool's preservation (CTG 400,000,000) 
• 1% goes to a DAO-managed charity fund/treasury, to which we contribute to a chosen cause every week based on a vote by the token-holder community.
 • 2% will support operational expenditures. 
• 1% is used for marketing and promotional materials, such as NFT promotional events, celebrity meals, experiences, prizes, and other token giveaways for lottery events and awarded to lottery participants once a month.


Anti Pump-Dump-Exit Whales for CTG 
● Donors have their CTG locked away for 180 days or until the campaign's donation cap has been met.

5.2 Ethereum Solidity Based Contract 

CTGCoin is an ERC20 token. The token contract is based on the ERC20 and ReentrancyGuard contracts offered by OpenZeppelin library.

5.3 Tokens Deployment and  
Tokens will be generated and transmitted to admin addresses upon deployment, as described in the Tokenomics section. 
Buyers will initially purchase tokens through promoted charity websites by sending ETH to the token contract. This procedure is based on the contract format provided by the legal organization.
